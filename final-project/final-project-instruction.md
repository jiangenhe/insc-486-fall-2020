# Final Project

You will work on a final project **independently**. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data analytics process to answer questions you have about a topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, process your data, run statistical analyses, build a machine learning model, and communicate results.

## Project Milestones

There are a few milestones for the final project.

1. **March 12, Friday**: Project Proposal (50 points, it is a part of Assignment 3.) 
2. **March 26, Friday**: Project Progress Updates 1 (25 points, it is a part of Assignment 4.)
3. **April 12, Friday**: Project Progress Updates 2 (25 points, it is a part of Assignment 5.)
4. **April 27 and 29:** Project Presentation (40 points for your presentation, 10 points for your participation in other students' presentations.)
5. **May 7**: Final Project Report (150 points).

## Deliverables

There are several deliverables for your project that will be graded individually to make up your final project score.

### Proposal

You need to describe the title, the motivation, the data, and the initial questions you want to answer through your analysis. The content can be incorporated into your final .

### Project Progress Updates

You need to submit your project updates twice, along with Assignment 4 and 5.

### Presentation

You will give a 15-minute presentation to show your analysis, results, and findings in classes of the last week.

### Project Report

You will use Colab Notebook to present your project report, including your writing, code, and visualizations.

The report should include the following topics. Depending on the project type, the amount of discussion devoted to each will vary:

- **Overview and Motivation**: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for them.
- **Related Work**: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.
- **Initial Questions**: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
- **Data**: Any data manipulation you conducted and give a brief rationale for your data processing
- **Exploratory Analysis**: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?
- **Statistical Analysis**: Your hypotheses and your statistical analysis for validating your hypotheses.
- **Machine Learning**: Build a supervised or unsupervised machine learning application for your data.
- **Findings and Conclusions**: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?

**You are expected to provide high-quality and readable code in your project report. Provide comments for your code when necessary.**

## Grading

Your final project is worth 300 points and 30% of your final grade. The final project will be graded for each deliverable. The grading criteria for each deliverable will be provided when the assignment is available.
